Here are some USB programs/drivers for Dragon PCI.

- dragon-ctrl is used to load design files from Linux instead of using Windows
FPGAConf provided by KNJN

Loading design needs to load firmware.hex first:


# dragon-ctrl -i firmware.hex reboot
# dragon-ctrl -b bitfile.bit program

If you want to save firmware to EEPROM you can use the following command:

# dragon-ctrl -i firmware.hex write-eeprom

- driver/dragon_usb is a Linux driver (kernel space) for Dragon. Please read
driver/dragon_usb/README.txt for more information.

Enjoy.
