DragonPCI-E utilities for Linux
===============================

Here are some Linux examples for KNJN DragonPCI-E board. Linux examples are 
mostly based on Windows examples provided by KNJN in the startup kit. 

Please note some examples are very close to DragonPCI ones (USB + PCI driver, 
dragon_pci_test utility, etc.)

Windows startup kit is needed to load design in board 'with FPCGconf' utility. 
Please refer to startup kit documentation for USB Windows driver installation, 
FPGCconf documentation, etc.

Linux examples are my personnal work *not* supported by KNJN.

Enjoy
